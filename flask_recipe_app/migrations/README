# Flask Recipe App Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts for the **Flask Recipe App**. Migrations are managed using [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/) and [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/).

---

## 📚 Overview

Database migrations are essential for evolving your application's schema without losing data or causing downtime. This project uses Flask-Migrate (built on Alembic) to handle all schema changes in a robust, version-controlled way.

---

## 🚀 Why Use Migrations?
- **Version Control:** Track every change to your database schema.
- **Team Collaboration:** Safely share and apply schema changes across your team.
- **Incremental Updates:** Apply only the changes you need, when you need them.
- **Rollback Support:** Revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.

---

## 📁 Directory Structure
- `versions/` — Auto-generated migration scripts (one per schema change).
- `README` — This file, explaining migrations and usage.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KenRobertOchieng/RECIPE-APP-.git
cd RECIPE-APP-/flask_recipe_app

# Running flask
export FLASK_APP=serve.app
python -m serve.seed
flask run

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
- Create a `.env` file or set environment variables as needed for your Flask app (e.g., `FLASK_APP`, `DATABASE_URL`).

### 5. Initialize the Database (First Time Only)
```bash
flask db init
```

### 6. Create a New Migration (Whenever Models Change)
```bash
flask db migrate -m "Describe your change"
```

### 7. Apply Migrations to the Database
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### 8. Run the Flask App
```bash
flask run
```

## 💡 Best Practices
- **Review scripts:** Always check generated migration scripts before applying.
- **Version control:** Commit migration scripts to your repository.
- **Stay in sync:** Run migrations after every model change.
- **Backup:** Always backup your database before running upgrades or downgrades in production.

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting
- For Flask-Migrate issues, see the [Flask-Migrate documentation](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/).
- For Alembic-specific issues, see the [Alembic documentation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/).
- If migrations fail, check for model/schema mismatches or missing dependencies.
